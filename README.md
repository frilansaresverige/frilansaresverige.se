## Husky and Conventional commit strategy üê∂ 
This repository uses husky git hooks adapter together with commitizen conventional commits. This ensures a unified code style and fail-fast commit strategy with clear messages. 

**For contributors not familiar with conventional commits**

Just go ahead and commit as usual:
```bash
git commit
git commit -m "message"
``` 

This will first run the pre-commit hooks provided through _husky_ which will run lint and format checks of your code using `next lint` and `prettier`.

You will then be prompted to fill in some required fields regarding your commit and commitizen will format the message for you. Easy peasy!
